## Overview
**PlatePal** is an application designed to provide tailored product recommendations for restaurants based on their menu ingredients. By inputting a restaurant name, users can receive a curated list of products to sell, enhancing their inventory and improving customer satisfaction.

## Project Background
The motivation behind this project was to bridge the gap between product suppliers and restaurants by offering personalized recommendations. By analyzing restaurant menus, we can suggest relevant products, ultimately helping restaurant owners make informed purchasing decisions.

## Install necessary dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the Application

To run the PlatePal application, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the main project directory:
```bash
python3 app.py
```

## Data Gathering
I built a web scraper to fetch restaurant menu data directly from Google. This approach enabled me to gather comprehensive menu information from various restaurants without the limitations posed by traditional APIs.
Navigate to the `src` directory:
   ```bash
   cd src
python3 restaurant_scrapper.py
```




## Data Processing
- **Parsing HTML**: I parsed the HTML of the fetched restaurant menu data to create mappings between restaurants and their menu items. This structured approach allowed for easier analysis and recommendations.

- **Handling Missing Values**: I replaced missing ingredients with suggestions generated by the Gemini large language model, ensuring that the data remained comprehensive. The notebook is located in the `notebook` folder under the name `ingredient_fill_gemini.ipynb`. 

- **Handling Weight Units and Noise**: I addressed weight units, punctuation, numerics, and other extraneous noise in the ingredient strings to standardize the data format.

- **Removal of Stop Words**: I implemented techniques to remove stop words from the ingredient lists, which helped in focusing on the most relevant terms.

- **Handling Outliers**: I applied methods to identify and handle outliers in the ingredient data to enhance the quality and accuracy of the analysis.

The data processing notebook is located in the `notebook` folder under the name `data_preprocessing.ipynb`. You can open and run this notebook to explore the data preprocessing steps.

## Product Catalogue
I possess a comprehensive product catalogue consisting of various items that can be sold to restaurants. For this initial implementation, I focused on product categories such as:
- Ham
- Cheese
- And other relevant categories

## Recommendation Logic
To generate product recommendations, I employed the following methods:
- **Cosine Similarity**: This technique measures the similarity between ingredient vectors and product categories.
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Fuzzy matching algorithms were used to handle variations in ingredient names.
- **Weighted Frequencies**: I assigned weightage to ingredient frequencies, giving more importance to frequently used ingredients in the recommendation process.

## Features
- Input the name of a restaurant to receive product recommendations.
- The application generates a list of the top 10 products to recommend based on the restaurant's menu.
- The recommendation system is designed to be flexible and can be expanded with additional data sources in the future.

## Model Explanation
To facilitate a deeper understanding of the model used in PlatePal, I have created a notebook that compares the results of my tool with those generated by ChatGPT. This notebook provides insights into the model's performance and its effectiveness in generating product recommendations.

The notebook is located in the `notebook` folder under the name `model_explanation.ipynb`. You can open and run this notebook to explore the model's workings and the comparative analysis.
## Future Work
- **Expand Data Sources**: Incorporate additional APIs and web scraping methods to gather menu data from more restaurants.
- **Improve Recommendation Algorithms**: Experiment with more advanced algorithms, such as machine learning models, to enhance recommendation accuracy. Utilize advanced indexing methods like FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to improve the speed and efficiency of similarity searches in high-dimensional spaces. Leverage LLMs to automatically extract themes and keywords from reviews and menu descriptions.
- **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface to allow restaurant owners and suppliers to easily access and utilize the application.

## Conclusion
PlatePal serves as an initial step towards creating a more data-driven approach to inventory management for restaurants. By leveraging menu data and a comprehensive product catalogue, the application aims to provide valuable insights that can benefit both restaurant owners and product suppliers.
