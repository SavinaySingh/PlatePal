## Overview
**PlatePal** is an application designed to provide tailored product recommendations for restaurants based on their menu ingredients. By inputting a restaurant name, users can receive a curated list of products to sell, enhancing their inventory and improving customer satisfaction.

## Project Background
The motivation behind this project was to bridge the gap between product suppliers and restaurants by offering personalized recommendations. By analyzing restaurant menus, we can suggest relevant products, ultimately helping restaurant owners make informed purchasing decisions.

## Data Gathering
I built a web scraper to fetch restaurant menu data directly from Google. This approach enabled me to gather comprehensive menu information from various restaurants without the limitations posed by traditional APIs.

## Data Processing
- **Parsing HTML**: I parsed the HTML of the fetched restaurant menu data to create mappings between restaurants and their menu items. This structured approach allowed for easier analysis and recommendations.

- **Handling Missing Values**: I replaced missing ingredients with suggestions generated by the Gemini large language model, ensuring that the data remained comprehensive.

- **Handling Weight Units and Noise**: I addressed weight units, punctuation, numerics, and other extraneous noise in the ingredient strings to standardize the data format.

- **Removal of Stop Words**: I implemented techniques to remove stop words from the ingredient lists, which helped in focusing on the most relevant terms.

- **Handling Outliers**: I applied methods to identify and handle outliers in the ingredient data to enhance the quality and accuracy of the analysis.

## Product Catalogue
I possess a comprehensive product catalogue consisting of various items that can be sold to restaurants. For this initial implementation, I focused on product categories such as:
- Ham
- Cheese
- And other relevant categories

## Recommendation Logic
To generate product recommendations, I employed the following methods:
- **Cosine Similarity**: This technique measures the similarity between ingredient vectors and product categories.
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Fuzzy matching algorithms were used to handle variations in ingredient names.
- **Weighted Frequencies**: I assigned weightage to ingredient frequencies, giving more importance to frequently used ingredients in the recommendation process.

## Features
- Input the name of a restaurant to receive product recommendations.
- The application generates a list of the top 10 products to recommend based on the restaurant's menu.
- The recommendation system is designed to be flexible and can be expanded with additional data sources in the future.

## Future Work
- **Expand Data Sources**: Incorporate additional APIs and web scraping methods to gather menu data from more restaurants.
- **Improve Recommendation Algorithms**: Experiment with more advanced algorithms, such as machine learning models, to enhance recommendation accuracy.
- **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface to allow restaurant owners and suppliers to easily access and utilize the application.

## Conclusion
PlatePal serves as an initial step towards creating a more data-driven approach to inventory management for restaurants. By leveraging menu data and a comprehensive product catalogue, the application aims to provide valuable insights that can benefit both restaurant owners and product suppliers.
